Just now I watched _Arrival_, an interesting perspective for a science fiction movie. Here comes my rants... ;-)

Language determines how we perceive the reality and not the reality itself. 
Our customs (habits or habitats for that matter) (re-) wires our brains and help 'to improve' perception.

How aborigines in Africa don't fall for these illusions demonstrates that the languages are not unique in how we perceive reality. 
Ofcourse, one's lifestyle can be shaped by the language just the other way around but the possible lifestyle will be constrained by the physical reality. 
An analogy would be like the relations between hardware and software. Software can optimise or abstract the capabilities of hardware but can't exceed it!

So, the claim that with a new language, we can see the future implies that time is directionless in reality and just we don't perceive it!
